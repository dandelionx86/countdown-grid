# countdown-grid
This is a simple flexbox grid. Each square is a button that changes color and displays the "Done" message when clicked. I made this as a countdown calendar to track my progress for #100DaysOfCode.

# To Do
How do I save the state of each button once it's clicked so that it stays marked off forever (or until I reset it)?
